# House-Price-Analysis
This dataset contains 1460 rows and 81 columns. I created database in MySQL workbench to analyze various features which  impact sale price of houses. Created business questions and answered it using data manipulation language in MySQL workbench. Then I transferred the data to tableau to perform data visualization and EDA. I created business dashboard which  was able to tell main features impacting sale price of houses. Then, I used python to impute missing values and checked for  outliers. I used log transformation to treat skewed distribution. Performed data analysis, data manipulation, Feature engineering  and Feature Scaling
